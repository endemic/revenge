# Revenge

Partial re-implementation of "[Rodent's Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent%27s_Revenge)", using [GridJS](https://github.com/endemic/gridjs).

As it's a commercial game (albiet abandonware), all features/levels have not been fully implemented; it was more of a fun project to create a web version of the basic game engine. You can basically keep infinitely playing the first level.
